# Comparing Authentication Approaches: With and Without API Gateway

Two common approaches to authentication in microservices are:

## API Gateway Handles Authentication and Authorization

How it works:

- The API Gateway acts as a centralized entry point.

- It validates tokens (e.g., JWTs), checks user permissions, and enforces access control before forwarding requests to downstream microservices.

- Microservices trust requests coming from the gateway and may perform lightweight token validation for zero-trust models.

Pros

- Centralizes authentication and authorization logic, simplifying maintenance.

- Reduces duplicated security code in microservices.

- Simplifies client interaction - clients call only one endpoint.

- Enables centralized rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.

- Reduces attack surface by hiding internal microservices.

Cons

- API Gateway can become a single point of failure or bottleneck.

- A compromised gateway risks all backend services.

- Gateway may become a "god object" if it handles too much business logic.

- Adds an extra network hop and slight latency.

Implementation Steps

1. Deploy an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, APISIX, NGINX, AWS API Gateway).

2. Configure the gateway to validate JWT tokens using public keys or shared secrets.

3. Implement authentication plugins (e.g., jwt-auth in APISIX).

4. Configure routing rules to forward requests to appropriate microservices.

5. Optionally, microservices perform lightweight token validation for defense-in-depth.

6. Implement centralized logging, rate limiting, and monitoring at the gateway.

## Each Microservice Handles Authentication and Authorization

How it works:

- Clients send JWT tokens directly to microservices.

- Each microservice independently validates tokens and enforces authorization.

- No centralized gateway for authentication; clients communicate directly with services.

Pros

- Aligns with zero-trust security - each service enforces its own security.

- Avoids single point of failure in the gateway.

- Services are fully autonomous and decoupled.

Cons

- Duplication of authentication and authorization logic across services.

- Harder to maintain and update security policies consistently.

- Clients must know endpoints of multiple services, increasing coupling.

- Larger attack surface since all services are exposed externally.

Implementation Steps

1. Implement token validation logic (JWT signature, expiry, claims) in each microservice.

2. Microservices enforce authorization based on token claims or external authorization calls.

3. Clients obtain tokens from a centralized Auth Service and include them in requests to each microservice.

4. Optionally, use service discovery or client-side load balancing for service endpoints.

5. Implement monitoring and logging in each service separately.

| Aspect                  | API Gateway Authentication                            | Each Microservice Authentication            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Security Centralization | High - centralized token validation and authorization | Distributed - each service validates tokens |
| Code Duplication        | Low - auth logic centralized in gateway               | High - duplicated in every service          |
| Client Complexity       | Low - single endpoint                                 | High - clients call multiple services       |
| Attack Surface          | Smaller - internal services hidden                    | Larger - all services exposed externally    |
| Single Point of Failure | Yes - gateway                                         | No                                          |
| Latency                 | Slightly higher - extra hop through gateway           | Lower - direct calls                        |
| Scalability             | Gateway can be bottleneck if not scaled               | Services scale independently                |
| Maintenance             | Easier - centralized policy updates                   | Harder - update all services                |
